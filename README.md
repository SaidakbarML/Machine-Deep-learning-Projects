CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

Overview:
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

Objective:
The goal is to develop an accurate image classification model capable of identifying objects and scenes represented in the images.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing
Model Development
Training and Evaluation
Performance Optimization
Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
Matplotlib

Dataset:
The CIFAR-10 dataset includes images across 10 classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
